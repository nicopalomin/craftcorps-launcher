## 4. Accounts & Identity

An account may exist even if you do not provide a username, email address, or password.

You are responsible for all activity performed through your account.

### 4.2 Account Linking & Authentication

* public or third-party sources.

CraftCorps does **not** guarantee:

* server availability or uptime,

Server listings may be ranked, filtered, or featured using automated systems based on factors such as:

* activity and reliability indicators,
* abuse or manipulation detection,
* verification status,
* featured or promotional placement (where applicable).

### 7.3 Abuse Prevention

CraftCorps uses automated safeguards to detect and prevent abusive or manipulative activity, including weighted evaluation of interaction and technical signals.

These safeguards may result in:

* discounted or ignored votes,
* limited interactions,
* restricted listing visibility,
* temporary or permanent restrictions.

These measures are intended to protect platform integrity and fairness and do not constitute legal or contractual decisions about users.

## 8. Playtime Tracking & Activity Metrics
