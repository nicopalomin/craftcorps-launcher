If you do not agree, you may not use the service.

## 4. Accounts & Identity

An account may exist even if you do not provide a username, email address, or password.

You are responsible for all activity performed through your account.

### 4.2 Account Linking & Authentication

CraftCorps may integrate with third-party authentication providers, including the **Mojang API**, to enable game authentication.

When you authenticate through Mojang or other providers:

* early access registrations,
* beta participation,
* waitlists or launch notifications,
* service-related communications.

Providing an email address is optional unless explicitly required for a specific feature.

## 5. Server Discovery & Third-Party Servers

### 5.1 Third-Party Servers

Server listings are provided by:

* server owners, or
* public or third-party sources.

CraftCorps does **not** guarantee:

Server listings may be ranked, filtered, or featured using automated systems based on factors such as:

* activity and reliability indicators,
* abuse or manipulation detection,
* verification status,
* featured or promotional placement (where applicable).

## 6. Server Owners

If you register or claim a server, you represent that you are authorized to manage it.

Server owners are responsible for:

### 7.3 Abuse Prevention

CraftCorps uses automated safeguards to detect and prevent abusive or manipulative activity, including weighted evaluation of interaction and technical signals.

These safeguards may result in:

* discounted or ignored votes,
* limited interactions,
* restricted listing visibility,

* display playtime information to you,
* enable progression, cosmetic, or beta systems,
* distribute promotional or loyalty rewards,

PART 2: PRIVACY POLICY
================================================================================

# PRIVACY POLICY

**CraftCorps Launcher & Server Discovery**

*Last updated: 2026-01-18*

## 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how CraftCorps (“CraftCorps”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and processes information when you use the CraftCorps launcher, server discovery features, and related services.

Some of the data we process may be considered **personal data** or **borderline personal data** (sometimes referred to as PII) depending on jurisdiction and context. We aim to be transparent about where those boundaries exist.

## 2. Who We Are (Data Controller)

CraftCorps is the **data controller** for information processed through the CraftCorps launcher and services.

Third-party services we use may act as **data processors** or **independent controllers**, as described below.

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Account & Identifier Data

We generate or process internal identifiers, including:

* an internal user ID,
* optional account credentials (username, email) if provided,
* account status and settings.

An account may exist without a username or email address unless required for a specific feature.

Usernames, when provided, may be linked to internal identifiers to enable account-based features.

### 3.2 Device Identifiers & Session Data

To operate the service, maintain sessions, and prevent abuse, we may process:

* a launcher-generated device or instance identifier,
* session identifiers,
* session start and end times,
* app version information.

These identifiers are used to maintain continuity, security, and abuse prevention. They are **not** used to access personal files or track users across unrelated applications.

Depending on jurisdiction, device identifiers may be considered personal data.

### 3.3 IP Addresses

IP addresses may be processed **only when required**, such as for:

* security and abuse prevention,
* rate limiting,
* crash diagnostics.

IP addresses are not used for advertising or long-term tracking and may be truncated, anonymized, or retained only for short periods where possible.

### 3.4 Authentication & Minecraft Accounts

When you authenticate using third-party providers (such as the **Mojang / Microsoft API**):

* authentication is handled by the provider,
* CraftCorps receives confirmation necessary to launch or connect the game.

Minecraft authentication tokens and credentials are stored **locally on your device** and are **not stored on CraftCorps servers**.

In the future, we may offer optional features that involve server-side token handling. If this occurs, this Privacy Policy will be updated and users will be informed.

### 3.5 No-Account & Pre-Login Usage

Before account creation or login, we may process limited data such as:

* anonymous or provisional identifiers,
* session-level activity,
* basic technical signals.

This data is used only to operate the launcher, enforce safeguards, and enable a smooth onboarding experience. It is not used to build long-term user profiles.

### 3.6 Analytics & Usage Events

We collect usage and interaction events to understand how the launcher and features are used. These may include:

* feature usage events,
* navigation or interaction events,
* timestamps,
* associated internal user or session identifiers (where available).

Some analytics data may be linked to an account after login. Other analytics may remain **anonymous or pseudonymous**.

Analytics data may be considered personal data depending on how it can be linked to an individual.

### 3.7 Analytics Profiles

We may maintain analytics profiles associated with internal identifiers to support product features and insights, including:

* first launch or login timestamps,
* last activity time,
* theme or preference settings,
* country or region (derived, when available),
* playtime metrics,
* streaks or participation counters.

These profiles are used to improve user experience and enable feature-related functionality.

### 3.8 Hardware & System Information

We may collect limited hardware and system information such as:

* operating system and version,
* CPU, GPU, and RAM details.

This data is used for:

* compatibility checks,
* diagnostics,
* performance analysis,
* abuse prevention.

We do not access personal files or unrelated device contents.

### 3.9 Playtime & Activity Metrics

We track playtime and related activity signals to:

* display playtime information to you,
* enable beta, cosmetic, or promotional features,
* determine eligibility for discretionary rewards,
* detect abuse or automated behavior.

Playtime tracking does not include monitoring in-game chat, content, or communications.

### 3.10 Server Interaction & Statistics

We process server-related interaction data, including:

* views, clicks, joins, and votes,
* join outcomes,
* aggregated and daily statistics.

Much of this data is aggregated at the **server level** rather than the individual user level, but may temporarily involve user or session identifiers for integrity and abuse prevention.

### 3.11 Abuse & Security Signals

We process limited technical and interaction signals to protect the platform, including:

* repeated or abnormal interaction patterns,
* vote or engagement manipulation indicators,
* automated or scripted behavior signals.

These signals may be evaluated using automated, weighted systems and are used solely for security and integrity purposes.

### 3.12 Crash & Diagnostic Data

If the launcher crashes or encounters errors, we may collect:

* crash reports,
* app version and platform,
* process type,
* optional IP address,
* optional internal user or session identifier.

Crash data is used only for debugging and stability improvements.

## 4. What We Do **Not** Collect

We do not:

* use data for advertising networks,
* monitor in-game chat or content,
* access personal files,
* intentionally track users across unrelated applications or services.

## 5. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

* **Consent** – where explicitly requested (such as email communications or optional analytics).

## 7. Automated Processing

CraftCorps uses automated systems to:

* rank and display servers,
* detect abuse or manipulation,
* analyze usage and join outcomes.

These systems do not make legal or similarly significant decisions about users. Human review may be applied where appropriate.

We do not use personal data to train general-purpose artificial intelligence models.

## 8. Third-Party Services

CraftCorps relies on third-party services to operate parts of the platform, including but not limited to:

* **Cloudflare** (network delivery and security),
* **Modrinth** (mod and content distribution),
* **Mojang / Microsoft services** (authentication),
* email delivery, hosting, analytics, and infrastructure providers.

These services operate under their own privacy policies and may process data independently.

## 9. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary for its purpose:

* session and analytics events: limited duration,
* abuse prevention data: as required for enforcement,
* crash diagnostics: short-term,
* aggregated statistics: longer-term for historical analysis,

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
